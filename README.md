Resources and notes for doing gardening inside and on the terrace

Used this resource https://homeguides.sfgate.com/plant-seeds-mini-greenhouse-46886.html.
I bought seeds for basil, coctail tomatos, chives, mint and parsley. I also bought a tiny greenhouse with 30 cells. Order:
1. basil
2. chive
3. mint
4. parsley
5. tomato
Each one has six cells.
